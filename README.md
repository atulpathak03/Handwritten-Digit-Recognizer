# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognizer using CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize handwritten digits using the popular **MNIST dataset**. It's a great beginner-friendly project for understanding **image classification**, **deep learning**, and **CNN architectures**.

---

## 📌 Overview

The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), each of size **28x28 pixels**. The goal of this project is to train a CNN to classify these images accurately.
